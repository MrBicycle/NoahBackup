In Windows add the batch script to "Task Scheduler"
In Linux make the script file executable with:
chmod +x noahScript
then add the task to cron 

Use an appropriate interval perhaps once per week for larger files. It isn't very verbose so just be aware that it is indeed working if no errors have been thrown up.
